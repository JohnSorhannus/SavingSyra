# SavingSyra

The following is the code for the final version of "Saving Syra," a fantasy game written as a semester long project in my object-oriented programming course. This repository includes classes that are meant to model players in the game as well as certain objects that they use. The purpose of this project was to learn object-oriented design techniques such as inheritance and polymorphism. In addition, memory management techniques were also utilized in this project. 

I wrote most of the code here. The following files were provided by my professor:

* dice.h
* gamespace.h
* voc.h
* wpn.h
* all .in files
